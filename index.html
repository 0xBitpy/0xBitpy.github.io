<i><bold>BEEP BEEP!</bold></i><br> 
Welcome to my website which is currently mostly an "archive" leading to other interesting<br>websites or projects I feel like deserve more attention and are worth sharing around.<br>This site also serves as my learning playground for web development<br>so it's constantly a work in progress and any tips or criticism is appreciated.
<br><br>
You can call me Bitpy, Bit or even just beep. I'm a hobbyist browsing the web for obscure stuff that<br>might spark my interest or teach me a fun fact that no one cares about. I also like video games, fucking around<br>with virtual machines and breaking my computer in many ways. Feel free to ask me for r/techsupport and I will help<br>in any way I can. Also if you have something you feel like sharing with me please do!<br> Whether it's a song, website, game or your own creation I'm down to hearing about it!

<br><br><br>
You can find me on:<br>
<i>nowhere since I have yet to figure out how this section will look like</i>
